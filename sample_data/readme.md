Sample data for reference purposes.

The influx_buckets folder contains sample data stored in InfluxDB during application usage.
Due to the nature of InfluxDB being a time-series database, importing this data for testing may not work as expected, as it has old timestamps.

The tests folder contains data obtained while training the random forest model, as well as other deprecated models.
