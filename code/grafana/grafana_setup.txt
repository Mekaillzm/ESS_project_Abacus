When setting up Grafana, do the following:

Create a data source called "inlfuxdb".
Important: Select Flux as the query language.

Use your credentials for inlfuxdb.
For reference, the previously used credentials are included below, though these are only valid on the original Docker container.

InfluxDB credentials:
Organisation: abacus-demo
Username: amdin
Password: admin123

Ensure all the required buckets have been created in influxDB, as outlined by Influx_setup_info.txt

Once done, create a new Dashboard.
Go to Settings > JSON model
Paste all code from model.json
Press save dashboard

Select a suitable refresh time and time window for the dashboard, based on how much past data you would like to see.
