Secondly, download and run the code, ensuring a stable WiFi connection.

Thirdly, check the code output (e.g. on a terminal) for its active URLs.
An example of the expected output is, "Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000"
Copy one and write it in the following format:
 http://0.0.0.0:5000/postData

Paste this as outlined in the Node-RED setup instructions.
