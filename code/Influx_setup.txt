The following buckets must be set up in InfluxDB v 2.x or above for the code to work correctly. 
InfluxDB must be added as a data source in Grafana as well. 

Access information has been included below, but this is for a local Docker container instance of InfluxDB. A new setup will require updated credentials that may or may not match the ones below.

Organisation name: abacus-demo
This organisation name has been used by Grafana and Node-RED to access the buckets outlined below.

Username: amdin
Password: admin123

The username may appear to be a typo at first glance, but it is not.

Names of working buckets:
-islamabadAQI
-islabadFeelsLike
-islamabadPredictions
-islamabadWeather
-karachiAQI
-karachiFeelsLike
-karachiPredictions
-lahoreAQI
-lahoreWeather
-lahorePredictions
-lahoreFeelsLike

On the InfluxDB web UI, you can upload the sample data as well; however, this may not work as the data contains past timestamps.
